Hi. Glad to meet you. Couple of words about myself : I used to think that ayahuasca and shamanism in general were the most exciting things to ever happen to humankind. So I nurtured a dream of one day going the Amazon forest, finding a teacher, getting him to teach me to become a shaman and then running aya ceremonies back where I'm from. Not as a business but as a life path. With no money for traveling I decided to enroll in Cultural Anthropology, to become more versed in a science that will let me approach the topic with some intelectual preparation.
Athropology - cool education to have but with relatively little market value. After wrapping up my studies, still with not enough money on the horizon to possibly go to the Amazon forest, I found a job in IBM as an IT Specialist with French. It was not my first run with It - my dad used to have abunch of workstations and he used to play Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Doom 2 with me on his lap. I got my first 486 Pc when I was 11 and my next pc I've pieced together myself when I was 17.
Fast forward some years spending working as a mountain guide, ice climbing coach and a divemaster, I'm back in studying CS with focus on Cpp and Javascript and I'm absolutely delighted to do that.
